The aim of this project is to authenticate a car plate number by reading its alphanumeric characters.
Inference will be running on a live camera feed, and to determine the order in which to read the characters, we will use the positions of the detections found using OpenCV. 
The code for this project is in Python, check out my [Github](https://github.com/mrjumping01/Plate-Number-Authentication) for code and more info.
